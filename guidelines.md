## 3. Security & Platform Openness

- We do **not exclude any users** based on who they are or what they run, as the cloud platform is designed to be open and customizable.
- Since the cloud software can be modified or extended by users (e.g., via source code changes), this flexibility is welcomed and not restricted.
